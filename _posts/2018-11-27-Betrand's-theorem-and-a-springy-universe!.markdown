Hi all!
Recently I took a course in Classical Mechanics and explored various cool things, one of which happens to be Betrand's theorem, which( Spoiler alert!) describes the type of central force and their associated orbits and much more.It'll be loads of fun learning about them.

Also, I have been troubled by the derivation of Least Action Principle. If you see Goldstein(or as someone blabbered - "the bible of Classical Mech), what he does is essentially taking a group of paths that differ each other by a single parameter and does the variation w.r.t to that parameter. The problem - How the hell is q independent of $$\frac{dq}{dt}$$ ? If you see the derivation, the variation in q manifests itself as a variation in $$\frac{dq}{dt}$$ too.
