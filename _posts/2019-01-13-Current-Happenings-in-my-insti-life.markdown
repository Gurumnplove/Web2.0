Hi Again!
As a new year starts, I would like to share what my 2 years(or that's what is
going to be) have been for me. Well, for starters, what's most starkly different
is the fact that opportunities, that seemed to fall upon my lap during high
school time, now have to be chased and pursued until they happen for you.
For example, be it scholarship exams, internships or projects, you have to keep looking
until that right match happens!
So the undergrad me has been constantly challenged to respond to deadlines, much so
that my productivity is kind of like this...
